## How to Use This Repo for Learning
- **Start with Python Basics**  
  Begin with [Ahmed Jajja’s AI & Data Science repo](https://github.com/Ahmadjajja/AI_n_DataScience).  
  Work through the Python notebooks first cover variables, loops, functions, and OOP until you’re comfortable.

- **Move to Advanced AI & Agents**  
  After Python, explore this repo (based on [Techloset’s Agentic-AI](https://github.com/techloset/agentic-ai)).  
  Here you’ll find projects on LangChain, multi-agent frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI), and building AI web apps with Next.js.

- **Practice & Compare**  
  Try each assignment on your own, then review the provided solutions and notes to see different approaches.

- **Run the Code**  
  1. Install dependencies:  
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
  2. Launch notebooks or scripts to experiment and extend the projects.

*Follow this path Python from Ahmed Jajja’s repo first, then the Agentic-AI material to build strong fundamentals and practical AI project skills*
